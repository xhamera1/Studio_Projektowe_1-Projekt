### 1. Product Vision

The **Intelligent Health Prediction System** is an innovative web application designed to proactively support users in managing their health. The system integrates personalized medical surveys, advanced AI-based prediction models, and generative language models to deliver understandable and actionable insights into potential health risks. The application serves an informational and educational role, motivating users to make informed decisions about their lifestyle and preventative care, while clearly communicating that it is not a medical diagnostic tool.

### 2. Key Features (MVP - Minimum Viable Product)

* **Authentication & Account Management Module**

  * Secure user registration and login functionality.
  * User profile management and GDPR-compliant (RODO) consent for data processing.
* **Data Collection Module**

  * An interactive interface for completing health surveys, including:
    * Diet and nutritional habits survey.
    * Blood test results survey (e.g., cholesterol levels, glucose).
    * Lifestyle survey (physical activity, sleep patterns, substance use).
    * Family medical history survey.
* **AI Prediction Module**

  * Processing of survey data by dedicated machine learning models.
  * Risk prediction for key diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes).
* **Results Interpretation Module (LLM)**

  * Integration with an external language model to translate prediction results into easily understandable language.
  * Generation of personalized recommendations for lifestyle changes and potential steps for consultation with a doctor.
* **Results Dashboard**

  * Clear visualization of prediction results using percentage-based risk indicators and charts.
  * Presentation of recommendations generated by the LLM.

### 3. System Architecture

The system will be implemented using a **service-oriented architecture** to ensure scalability, flexibility, and maintainability.

* **Frontend (Client):** A Single Page Application (SPA) built with **React**. It will handle the entire user interface, interactions, and communication with the backend via a REST API.
* **Backend (API Gateway & Core Logic):** A core server application based on **Spring Boot (Java)**. It will act as an API gateway, manage business logic, handle authentication/authorization, and orchestrate communication between the client and the AI service.
* **AI Service (Prediction Service):** An independent microservice written in **Python** (using a framework like FastAPI) that exposes the machine learning models via its own REST API. The backend will communicate with this service, sending data for analysis and receiving prediction outcomes. This separation facilitates independent development and scaling of the AI models.
* **Database:** A relational database, such as **Azure Database for PostgreSQL**, to store user data, surveys, and results.
* **External API (LLM):** Communication with a selected language model API (e.g., OpenAI API) will be handled on the backend to secure API keys and maintain control over prompts.

#### Data Flow

1. A user completes a survey in the React application.
2. The data is sent to the backend API (Spring Boot).
3. The backend validates the data and forwards it to the AI service (Python/FastAPI).
4. The AI service performs the prediction and returns the result (e.g., a JSON object with a disease probability).
5. The backend receives the result, enriches it with an interpretation from the LLM, saves it, and makes it available to the client.
6. The React application displays the final results on the user's dashboard.

## 4. Deployment & Hosting Strategy (Azure)

The application will be deployed on **Microsoft Azure**, utilizing the **Azure for Students** offer.

### Frontend (React)

- Hosted on **Azure Static Web Apps** for optimized performance and integrated **CI/CD**.

### Backend (Spring Boot)

- Deployed as a **container** to **Azure App Service** for simplified management and scaling.

### AI Service (Python)

- Deployed as a **container** to **Azure Container Apps**, allowing the microservice to **scale independently**.

### Database

- A fully managed **Azure Database for PostgreSQL** will be used for data persistence.

### CI/CD

- **GitHub Actions** will automate the **build**, **test**, and **deployment** pipeline for all components.
